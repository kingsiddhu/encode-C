## Getting Started

pip install encode-C
```


If you want to install the newest version from git, you can install like this:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/kingsiddhu/encode-C.git
```


If you want to easily edit the source, it's recommended to clone the git
repo and install as develop like this. Make sure you have git installed. https://git-scm.com/
